# Immigrant Stories
Our mission is to let immigrants have a voice by providing a platform where they can upload their personal narratives. Rather than focusing on their struggles, we aim to challenge dominant perspectives. This archive serves as a living testament to the resilience, struggles, and triumphs of those who have journeyed across borders, ensuring that their stories are preserved. 

## Made With
This project was made with Next.js and TailwindCSS.
